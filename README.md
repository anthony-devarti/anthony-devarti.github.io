# My First Blog Post
<p>Here we are, well into the first week of bootcamp and I'd like to share a bit of my experience so far. </p>
<h3> Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>
The content of week 1 definitely differed from my expectations quite a bit. This course seems like it's not only covering _material_ that is pretty foreign to me, but also a learning and progression method that's novel to me as well.  The unfamilarity with the material itself, however, is pretty in line with both my expectations and standard learning path.  I generally expect to feel pretty under water for a decent chunk of time when learning a new skill, at least to the point where I move from <strong>learning to read</strong> the concepts to <strong>reading to learn</strong> the concepts.<br>
<h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3> 
I'm most excited about potential applications that will provide context to the concepts themselves.  For example, this assignment is giving me an opportunity to apply some of the <strong><em>cool markup techniques</em></strong> I learned in my first few days. 
<h3> What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h3> 
I absolutely love board games.  You've got the whole package, here.  Boardgamegeek account, matching binders for rule books, coin capsules, plano tackle boxes, 30 different sizes of sleeves for every component.  Seriously, it borders on compulsive behavior:cold_sweat:.  I especially love cooperative, narrative-driven games like Nemesis, Arkham Files Games (pick any of them, really), and Zona.  Here's part of the game shelf where I keep most of my favorites:
