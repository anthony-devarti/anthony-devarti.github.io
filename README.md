My Coding Boothcamp Journey
# My First Blog Post
<p>Here we are, well into the first week of bootcamp and I'd like to share a bit of my experience so far. </p>
### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
The content of week 1 definitely differed from my expectations quite a bit. This course seems like it's not only covering _material_ that is pretty foreign to me, but also a learning and progression method that's novel to me as well.  The unfamilarity with the material itself, however, is pretty in line with both my expectations and standard learning path.  I generally expect to feel pretty under water for a decent chunk of time when learning a new skill, at least to the point where I move from **learning to read** the concepts to _**reading to learn**_ the concepts.

### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
I'm most excited about potential applications that will provide context to the concepts themselves.  For example, this assignment is giving me an opportunity to apply some of the <em>cool markup techniques</em> I learned in my first few days. 
### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? 
I absolutely love board games.  You've got the whole package, here.  Boardgamegeek account, matching binders for rule books, coin capsules, plano tackle boxes, 30 different sizes of sleeves for every component.  Seriously, it borders on compulsive behavior:cold_sweat:.  I especially love cooperative, narrative-driven games like Nemesis, Arkham Files Games (pick any of them, really), and Zona.  Here's part of the game shelf where I keep most of my favorites:

# One Week In

### What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
Something I would like to be able to do is to make a simple, web-based tool or application that would serve some sort of function.  Something small like a dice roller web page.  I find small side projects like this provide a consequence free canvas for me to experiment and test new techniques or lessons on, and would likely grow more complicated over time.

### What are you struggling with?
One struggle that I keep finding myself running into seems to be surrounding vocabulary.  When I come across a word or concept that I don't recognize, I look up that word, which often leads down a rabbit hole of more content that is new to me.  This can cause reading documentation or descriptions to become very involved, very quickly, as each term can lead to an exponentially increasing amount of content to consume, where one new term leads to three, which each lead to three new terms, each of which lead to three new terms. .  It's all very interesting, but I have looked at the clock after getting 4 layers deep and realize that I have spent an hour on a single sentence!  

### How do you solve a problem? 
I read.  A lot.  If I run into an issue, I find a resource (skill growth has and will continue to help me to recognize and find good, reliable resources more quickly), and dive in.  After reading, I dive in and start experimenting to try to apply the reading.

### What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
If I find myself stuck, I try to give myself another task to work on.  I like to keep a running to-do list at all times, and if I can't complete one task, I will try to get it to a stable, fresh starting point, then move onto something else.  When I come back, I can try to apply "fresh eyes" to the problem and that can help me look at it from another angle.  I also try to think of other places I have seen this successfully implemented, and look to see how it was addressed there.  If I look at a few places and find that multiple are solving the problem the same way, I do a deep dive in reading about that solution, to see if I can understand why it was used, how it works, and if that solution is applicable to my situation.
