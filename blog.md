# My First Blog Post
- ### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
The content of week 1 definitely differed from my expectations quite a bit. This course seems like it's not only covering _material_ that is pretty foreign to me, but also a learning and progression method that's novel to me as well.  The unfamilarity with the material itself, however, is pretty in line with both my expectations and standard learning path.  I generally expect to feel pretty under water for a decent chunk of time when learning a new skill, at least to the point where I move from learning to read the concepts to reading to learn the concepts.<br>
- ### What are you excited or eager to learn more about? 
I'm most excited about potential applications that will provide context to the concepts themselves.  For example, this assignment is giving me an opportunity to apply some of the _**cool markup techniques**_ I learned in my first few days. 
- ### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? 
I've got those classic absetsos hands that you get from cooking your whole life.
